This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Project Overview

# AI-Powered Code Editor Platform

A modern, AI-enhanced code editing platform built with Next.js and OpenAI integration.

## How it Works

### Core Architecture
The platform is built on Next.js 15 with TypeScript, following the App Router pattern for optimal performance and developer experience. It employs a client-server architecture where API routes handle AI interactions securely. The system integrates Monaco Editor for a professional code editing experience and leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 model for intelligent code assistance and generation. The architecture ensures real-time feedback and responsive user interactions through efficient state management and streaming responses.

### Frontend Components
The user interface is crafted using modern web technologies including Radix UI primitives and Tailwind CSS for a polished look and feel. A responsive sidebar provides intuitive navigation and project management capabilities. The core editing experience is powered by Monaco Editor, offering features like syntax highlighting and intelligent code completion. The platform includes a visual programming interface built with @xyflow/react, enabling users to create and manipulate code flows visually.

### AI Integration
The platform's intelligence is powered by secure OpenAI API integration implemented server-side. Real-time code generation is achieved through streaming responses, ensuring immediate feedback. The system uses carefully crafted prompts to generate contextually appropriate code suggestions. Error handling and recovery mechanisms ensure a smooth experience even when AI services encounter issues.

### User Interface Features
The interface includes a comprehensive notification system for user feedback and important alerts. Interactive elements like tooltips and dialogs enhance user experience and provide contextual help. The platform supports both dark and light themes for comfortable coding in any environment. The workspace layout is customizable through resizable panels, allowing users to optimize their coding environment.

### Development Infrastructure
The codebase maintains high quality through TypeScript's type safety and ESLint's code quality checks. Development workflow is optimized with hot reloading for immediate feedback during development. Styling is handled through a modern PostCSS and Tailwind pipeline for maintainable and scalable CSS. The project structure follows best practices for Next.js applications, ensuring good performance and maintainability.
